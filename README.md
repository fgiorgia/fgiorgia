### Hi there, I'm Giorgia 👋
#### BSc in Psychology. Passionate in Human Sciences, Tech and Statistics / Data Analysis

## Education
### 🎓💁‍♀ University of Cagliari: BSc of Psychological Sciences and Technique
I’m close to graduating, I completed most of my courses and I have a high GPA. In particular, I obtained the highest grade in (among others) Psychometry and Advanced Psychometry, during which I also helped fellow students to improve their understanding of the subject. I also developed automatic spreadsheets that produce results, intermediate steps and charts of statistical data.

### 🇬🇧👩‍🏫 English Language Advanced Training 
I practice English with native teachers from different countries of the English speaking world. This let me acquire great fluency and pronunciation and a job-grade level of English, which allowed me to start an English teaching side job.

### 📜👩‍🔬 Scientific Lyceum Diploma 
Being very fond of mathematical, scientific and humanistic studies, I was able to complete the last-year course of Math in just 18 hours and get the maximum grade.

## Work Experience
### 🇬🇧👩‍🏫 English Teacher 
I teach English to fellow students, starting from the fundamentals of the language up to being able to have simple but fluent everyday conversations in English. I also create lessons’ material like slides, exercises and charts to aid the learning process.

### 👩‍💻📖 Secretary and Magazine Designer 
I collected, archived and refactored classifieds sent by the customers. I also contributed to the design and pagination of the magazine using graphics and desktop publishing software. 

### 👩‍🍼🤕 Child Care Assistant for Hospitalised Children 
I assisted children by making their environment as comfortable and relaxing as possible during their stay at the hospital. I could help them by playing and guiding them through many creative projects like drawing, painting and learning découpage.

### 👩‍🍼🧸 Babysitter 
I nannied and took care of children from 0 to 8 years old. I assisted them with homework and accompanied and educated them while playing various games and activities.
